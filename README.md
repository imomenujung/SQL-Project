## [Telco Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/imomenujung/SQL-Project/tree/main/Data-Analyst/Churn-Prediction)
The GitHub project "Telco Customer Churn Prediction" involves To predict customer churn using machine learning and analyze churn patterns. Key aspects of the project include:
1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** Loaded dataset, checked for null values, performed exploratory analysis using SQL queries.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Created 'tenure_group' and 'charges_group' features to categorize tenure and monthly charges.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Encoded categorical features using LabelEncoder.
4. **Model Training:** Split data into training and testing sets, trained a RandomForestClassifier model.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
6. **Churn Analysis:** Analyzed churn rate by tenure group and charges group using SQL queries.
